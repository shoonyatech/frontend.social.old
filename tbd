Why mix and match?
	Kind of projects that need this
	
Different from moving Angular to React
	This is coexisting 
	
Anatomy of React, Angular
	Both manipulate DOM,
	has own engine to update component tree
		Gets difficult when there are multiple components scattered across a page built using different framework

Common language to talk: js, iframe, wc

iframe:
	componentlib.org
	
Framework in built in browser
	WC best support
	React, Angular support coming in
	Vendor.js is still different for every project as per node_modules added 
	
Complexity is added by state management
	
Web Assembly

Concerns
    Fit them together
    Share style
    Communication between them 
    Share state

WC  
    convert react to wc
    wrap react as wc

Nano apps

Routing - whose responsibility
